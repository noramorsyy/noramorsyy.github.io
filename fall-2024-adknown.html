      <h2>Learning Goals</h2>
      <h3>Information literacy in data technologies</h3>
      <p>
        I enhanced literacy in Python, SQL and AWS by reading documentation, blogs and forums and applying best practices in projects.
        I asked my manager questions when needed. This improved accuracy and speed and increased confidence.
      </p>
      <h3>Data visualization skills</h3>
      <p>
        I improved skills in Grafana for monitoring. I built dashboards for key metrics and iterated based on feedback.
        The dashboard helped the team address issues quickly. I am now more confident using visualization tools.
      </p>
      <h3>Creative thinking</h3>
      <p>
        I worked on creative thinking for new features and coding challenges. I tried different approaches and drew ideas from open source projects.
