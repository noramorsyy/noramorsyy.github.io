        The areas of computer science most relevant to my role included <strong>data analysis and automation with Excel and Power Query</strong>,
        <strong>reporting workflows</strong>, <strong>validation processes</strong> and <strong>technical documentation</strong> to support accurate and efficient operations.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section card" id="goals">
      <h2>Goals</h2>

      <h3>Goal 1 - Technological Literacy</h3>
      <p>
        My first goal was to become highly skilled in Excel and Power Query to better support reporting and data analysis.
        I learned advanced functions such as XLOOKUP, pivot tables and conditional formatting while building workflows in Power Query to merge and transform data.
        I sought feedback and refined my work to increase efficiency.
        By the end of the term I automated month end reporting with Power Query which reduced manual work and produced cleaner outputs.
        I now feel confident creating efficient and maintainable reporting solutions.
      </p>

      <h3>Goal 2 - Professional & Ethical Behaviour (Teamwork)</h3>
      <p>
        I aimed to strengthen my ability to work collaboratively and contribute effectively to team initiatives.
        I participated in meetings, shared updates, asked clarifying questions and supported my teammates when needed.
        Proactive communication helped me build trust and establish myself as a reliable contributor.
        I received positive feedback from teammates and my manager which confirmed that my efforts made a difference.
      </p>

      <h3>Goal 3 - Critical & Creative Thinking (Problem Solving)</h3>
      <p>
        I focused on improving problem solving by thinking critically and finding efficient ways to complete tasks.
        When challenges arose I brainstormed options, observed how others approached issues and suggested workflow improvements.
        For example I recommended automating a manual reporting step with Power Query which saved time and reduced errors.
        These experiences made me more resourceful and confident when tackling problems.
      </p>

      <h3>Goal 4 - Communicating (Oral)</h3>
      <p>
        I wanted to strengthen my networking skills and oral communication by building connections and learning about different roles across the organization.
        I set up coffee chats with colleagues from other teams, asked thoughtful questions and engaged more in team discussions.
        These conversations provided insight into career paths and roles at CIBC and improved my confidence in professional settings.
      </p>

      <h3>Goal 5 - Communicating (Written)</h3>
      <p>
        I worked to improve my written communication by producing clear documentation that others could follow.
        I documented processes I handled such as the monthly data merge and created job aids and step by step guides.
        I sought feedback to refine the documents and align them with internal standards.
        The outputs were adopted by my team with minimal edits and became useful references for ongoing work.
